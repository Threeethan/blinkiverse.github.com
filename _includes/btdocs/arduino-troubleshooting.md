## Troubleshooting

If the program fails to compile or upload, or the BlinkyTape is not doing what
you expected, there could be a number of things to check.

### Compile Errors

See if you can fix the compile errors. Check the
[Arduino programming reference](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage)
if you get stuck.

### Upload Errors

* Check to make sure that your BlinkyTape is connected to your computer via a
micro-USB cable.
* Check to make sure that your **Tools | Board** setting is set to
**Arduino Leonardo**.
* Check to make sure that your **Tools | Serial Port** setting is set to the
right thing.
