# About Blinkiverse

Blinkiverse is [Max](http://mmmaaa.xxx) and [Matt](http://cibomahto.com), two dedicated makers from Brooklyn. We enjoy collaborating on interactive art projects.


# Where the Party Is
We're located in Brooklyn, New York. We primarily work out of [NYC Resistor](http://nycresistor.com), our home-base hackerspace.
