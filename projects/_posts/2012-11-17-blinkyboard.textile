Plug your LED strip right into your USB port! The Blinkyboard is a tiny, Arduino-compatible companion to popular digitally-controlled, individually-addressable RGB LED strips. The Blinkyboard has a Mini-USB port on one side and pads on the other â€“ perfect for interfacing with the popular LPD8806 LED strips (and others!).

This is an open-source project, designed to be hackable. Design files and source code for this project can be found in our github repository.
